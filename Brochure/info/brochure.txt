Meeting the Big Data Challenge is not just about building faster computers, it is about smarter computing. The Challenge is not to find brute force correlations in Big Data, it is to identify fundamental relationships, to expand our understanding of the physical universe. The Challenge is about more than solving today’s problems; we want to set the stage for breakthroughs we have barely begun to imagine. 
At IDIES we develop faster, smarter, better techniques to access and analyze Big Data, enabling the global scientific community to find Big Answers to Big Questions.
Be part of the team that makes it happen. With your help, we will meet, and master, the Big Data Challenge.

Alex Szalay, founder of IDIES,
began in the mid 1990’s
with a grant from the Seaver
Foundation, followed by the
Moore and Keck Foundations.
Alex leveraged the seed
money, hiring postdocs and
researchers to realize his
vision of a scientific big data
revolution.

[andrew pic]
Professor Andrew Connolly
of the Univ. of Washington,
once a post-doc working
with Alex Szalay, now shapes
the scientific future of the
LSST (Large Synoptic Survey
Telescope).

[charles and tom]
The Institute for Data
Intensive Engineering and
Science (IDIES) fosters
research in data-intensive
science, with emphasis on
problems of national interest
in science and engineering.

[Pi-hD]
Alex Szalay is working to
reinvent the PhD at Johns
Hopkins with a “PI” shaped
training format – deep training
in two disciplines (e.g.
biochemistry and computer
science).

2001: SDSS releases 100
Gigabytes in its first Early
Data Release.
2012: SDSS releases 10
Terabytes in Data Release 12.
2021: LSST is projected to
release 1.5 Petabytes per
year.

[sdss]
The Sloan Digital Sky Survey
(SDSS) has created the most
detailed three-dimensional
maps of the Universe ever
made, with deep multi-color
images of one third of the sky,
and spectra for more than
three million astronomical
objects.

[sciserver]
SciServer is a ambitious
cyberinfrastructure project
funded by the NSF to enable
universal access to and
analysis of large scientific
datasets.

[lsst]
IDIES researchers are working
with the Large Synoptic
Survey Telescope (LSST) to
optimize database storage and
access so that researchers
around the world can access
its expected 15 Petabytes of
catalog data.
